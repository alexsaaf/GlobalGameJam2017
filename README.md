# Global GameJam 2017: MEHUKATTI
All of your kittens have fallen into a juice-making machine! The only way to save them is to stop the machine, and the only way to stop the machine is to fill it's juice tanks! But your cats are not the only cats in the machine, your opponents cats have also fallen in. You can fill the juice tanks by pushing your opponents cats into the juice maker before your cats end up as juice! At you command you have a bunch of wave machines, which can be activated by playing tones to the beat of the music (Convenient, right?). You must avoid a Catastrophe.
